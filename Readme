IFC Data Loss Detector
This tool detects data loss (entities, materials, images, properties, and element-level materials) between an original IFC design file and its exported-imported version.
It checks for missing elements and reports discrepancies in CSV files.
Prerequisites
    Python 3.7+ installed.
    Required Python packages: pip install ifcopenshell
Files
    ifc_data_loss_detector.py: The main script.
    Your original IFC file (e.g., design.ifc).
How to Run (Step-by-Step)
    Place your IFC file (e.g., design.ifc) in the working directory (same folder as the script or specify full paths).
    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Run the script with the required arguments: python ifc_data_loss_detector.py --design design.ifc
Example with all arguments: python ifc_data_loss_detector.py --design design.ifc --exported output/exported.ifc --imported output/imported.ifc --report reports/missing_data_report.csv
